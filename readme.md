# UncoverPC

## **Purpose:**

UncoverPC aims to help users save money when it comes to buying a gaming computer. Instead of buying a prebuilt gaming computer from BestBuy, or Canada Computers, UncoverPC will tell you exactly how much you can save by building the exact same PC yourself, and where to buy the components! On average it induces a savings of ~30%.
